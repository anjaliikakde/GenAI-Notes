This book is aimed at the data scientist with some familiarity with the R
programming language, and with some prior (perhaps spotty or ephemeral)
exposure to statistics. Both of us came to the world of data science from the world
of statistics, so we have some appreciation of the contribution that statistics can
make to the art of data science. At the same time, we are well aware of the
limitations of traditional statistics instruction: statistics as a discipline is a century
and a half old, and most statistics textbooks and courses are laden with the
momentum and inertia of an ocean liner.
